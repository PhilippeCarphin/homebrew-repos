#+TITLE: Repos

A tool that checks on all your repos.

#+begin_example
$ repos
ci.fstcomp       Clean No untracked files 406  Hours
linkcgo          Dirty Untracked Files    404  Hours
go.voir          Dirty Untracked Files    436  Hours
#+end_example

configured in a =~/.repos.yml= file.

* Install and use

Get the binary by building or downloading (see next sections).  Put it somewhere in your path.

Create a =~/.repos.yml= file like this:

#+begin_src yaml
repos:
  RepoName:
    path: "/path/to/git/repo"
  MyOtherRepoName:
    path: "/path/to/other/git/repo"
config:
  color: true
  defaults:
    # Default values for repo
#+end_src

and simply run the binary that you built or downloaded.

Note: I don't check if the directory is a git repo.  So if it exists and is not
one, then my program will be confused.  If the path doesn't exist, you will get
a nice error message.


* Download

Download the latest version built by CI:
[[https://gitlab.com/philippecarphin/repos/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=build]]

Use the right file for your OS and architecture.  If you are not sure, that
means that you are on =amd64= (if your computer was =arm=, you would be aware of
it).

* Build

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/philippecarphin/repos
cd repos
go build
#+end_src
