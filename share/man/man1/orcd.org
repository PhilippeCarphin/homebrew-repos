* NAME

orcd - cd to to the path of a repo by its name in alternate repos config files.

* SYNOPSIS

#+begin_src shell
orcd NAME REPO
orcd NAME REPO/SUBDIR
#+end_src

* DESCRIPTION

This function is like =rcd= but with an alternate config file specified by
=NAME=.

This is used to have other sets of repos perhaps those of colleagues on a
shared filesystem.

The alternate config file is =~/.config/repos/${NAME}.yml=.

This function has autocomplete similar to =rcd= except that for the first
argument, it proposes the names of files without =.yml= of files in
=~/.config/repos/=.

The second argument is comleted the same way as the first argument of =rcd=.

Use something like
#+begin_src
repos find -F ~/.config/repos/dan.yml --merge --cleanup DIR_WHERE_DAN_PUTS_HIS_REPOS
#+end_src
