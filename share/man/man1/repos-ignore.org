#+TITLE: repos-add
* NAME
repos-ignore - Set the ignore flag of a repo

* SYNOPSIS

#+begin_src shell
repos-ignore [-F CONFIG_FILE] [--name NAME] [PATH]
#+end_src

* DESCRIPTION

This excludes the repo from showing up in the global report if it is ahead or
behind its remote.

The repo will still appear if there are staged or unstaged changes or untracked
files.

This is useful for repositories that are only for consultation purposes and get
frequent updates.

Ignored repos can still be shown in the globla report if by calling repos
with the =--all= flag.

* EXAMPLE

If the =git= repository is cloned to look at its source code, it may not be
desirable to show it in the global report just because some upstream commits
have appeared.

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/git/git
cd git
repos add
repos ignore
#+end_src

Once in a while, =repos -all= can be run to see ignored repos and update them.
