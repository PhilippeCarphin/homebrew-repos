#+TITLE: repos-add
* NAME
repos-del - delete a repo from disc and remove it from the config file

* SYNOPSIS

#+begin_src shell
repos-add [-F CONFIG_FILE] [--name NAME] [PATH]
#+end_src

* DESCRIPTION

This tool deletes a repository from disc and removes its entry in the config
file at the same time.

It is safer than =rm -rf= (the normal way to delete a repo) because it will
abort under certain conditions:

- The repo is in detached head state
- The current branch does not track a remote branch
- There are untracked files
- Threre are staged or unstaged changes
- The current branch is behind its remote counterpart

These conditions are *NOT* a garantee that no work will be lost.  If did work
on a branch and did not push it, then checked out another branch, the tool
will not detect it.

*ONLY USE THIS IF YOU WOULD BE READY TO =rm -rf= THE REPO*
