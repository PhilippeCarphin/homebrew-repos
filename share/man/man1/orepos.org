* NAME

orepos - shortcut for repos with alternate config file

* SYNOPSIS

#+begin_src shell
orepos NAME [options to repos]
#+end_src

* DESCRIPTION

This command is like =repos= but with an alternate config file specified by
=NAME=.

This is used to work with other sets of repos perhaps those of colleagues on a
shared filesystem.

The alternate config file is =~/.config/repos/${NAME}.yml=.

This function has autocomplete similar to =repos= except that for the first
argument, it proposes the names of files without =.yml= of files in
=~/.config/repos/=.

This shell function is simply a shortcut:
#+begin_src
orepos(){
      repos -F ~/.config/repos/${NAME}.yml -no-fetch "$@"
}
#+end_src
where the =-no-fetch= is added by default because the intention is to work
with other people's repos.  We usually cannot run =git fetch= in other
people's repos because we don't have permission to modify their files.
