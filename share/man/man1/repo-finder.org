#+TITLE:generate-completion

* NAME

repo-finder - find git repositories and generate output for repos config file


* SYNOPSIS

#+begin_src shell
repo-finder > ~/.config/repos.yml
#+end_src

Recursively search the following subdirectories of ~PWD~ for git repositories

- go/src/gitlab.science.gc.ca
- Repositories
- repos
- Repos
- workspace
- Documents/GitHub
- Projects
- code
- projects
- git
- Git
- GIT
- WORKSPACE
- work
  
I have plans to make =repos -generate-config= take a list of directories as a
parameter and avoid the need to do this.


For now, one can get a more custom solution by crafting their own tool using the main
executable ~repos~ and the non-recursive =-generate-config= command.

#+begin_src shell
for d in $(cat dirlist.txt) ; do
    repos -generate-config
done >> ~/.config/repos.yml
#+end_src
