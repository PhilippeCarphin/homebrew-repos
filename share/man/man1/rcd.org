#+TITLE: rcd

* NAME

rcd is a shell function that changes directory to the path of the named repo
from ~$HOME/.config/repos.yml~.

* SYNOPSIS

#+begin_src shell
rcd REPO
#+end_src

Change to the path associated to ~REPO~ in ~$HOME/.config/repos.yml~.  This
function has autocompletion.

See ~man (1) repos~ for more information about the ~repos~ command and the
~repos.yml~ configuration file.

* BUGS
The accompanying script =repos_completion.bash= defines autocomplete and the
~rcd~ that takes a repo name.  It uses the ~repos~ executable.  If there is no
~$HOME/.config/repos.yml~, the ~rcd~ shell function will not work.
