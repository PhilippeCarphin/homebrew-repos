#+TITLE: rcd

* NAME

rcd - cd to to the path of a repo by its name in repos config file.

* SYNOPSIS

#+begin_src shell
rcd REPO
rcd REPO/SUBDIR
#+end_src

* DESCRIPTION

Change directory (=cd=) to the path associated to ~REPO~ in
~$HOME/.config/repos.yml~.  If a =SUBDIR= is specified, then change to that
directory within the path of the repo.

See ~man (1) repos~ for more information about the ~repos~ command and the
~repos.yml~ configuration file.

The autocompletion for this function autocompletes with repo names, then if a
=/= is present and the token before the first =/= is a valid repo name,
autocompletion completes with subdirectories of the path associated with that
repo name.

* CAVEATS

No error message is printed if there is no =~/.config/repos.yml=.
